# Functional requirements:
> Users should be able to create an account and login
 
> All the calls should be authenticated (except login and register)
 
> Implement two user roles with different permission levels: a regular user would only be
able to CRUD on their owned records and an admin would be able to CRUD all records
and users (including other admins)

> Each user can have only one collection of player cards (user is identified by an email)

> When the user is signed up, they should get a collection of 5 cards (the system should
generate the player cards automatically)
 
> The name of the players from the cards and eventually their skill level should be
generated by a 3rd party API at your choice. The connection to the external web service
must be done asynchronously

> Each player card has an initial value of 100 coins

> Each player has a budget of 500 coins to buy other cards

> When logged in, a user can see his/her information and the value of their collection:
username and country (can be edited), collection value (sum of player cards values)

> A player card has the following information: name, age, skill level and market value

> Users can add their cards to an internal exchange market

> When a user places a card on the market, they must set the asking price/value for that
player card. This value should be listed on the market. When another user buys this
player, they must bought it for this price

> Each user should be able to see all cards from the exchange market

> With each buy/sell, collection budgets are updated

> When a card is bought by another player, its value should be increased based on a
machine learning algorithm at your choice. Aim for a good accuracy score.

> The API will return all the info in the JSON format and will use a database to provide
data persistence (the usage of SQLite is discouraged)

> The API should be able to support pagination for all the endpoints that return a list of
elements

> Use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc. to test the API

> Write unit tests (not integration tests) so you can reach at least 50% code coverage for
the developed application. Use mocks for external dependencies.
